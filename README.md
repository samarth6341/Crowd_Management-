CrowdView is a software that business enterprises can use to gather crowd management insights in their public spaces. The software can be modified to detect people zone wise, marking safe and unsafe zones. In the most generic implementation, the user can input their CCTV video feed and get a plot of number of pople plotted against time. This implementation can be accessed through the website. More advanced implementations have been demonstrated in the included file, but do not work on the given website as they require custom parameters.
